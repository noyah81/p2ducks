## Blueprinting

![blueprint](static/assets/blueprint.jpg)

All members of our group created the blueprints together (sharescreen via zoom). Each blueprint page represents a page that will be on our finished site, with a description of the feature, and the group member that has been assigned to the task.

## Scrum Board
All members are assigned to at least one "in progress" task, and one "backlog" task in accordance with our project plan.
